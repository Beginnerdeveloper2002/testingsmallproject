- 👋 Hi, my name is Piotrek (when you translate it to english it means Peter). I am 21 years old polish kid. My graduation is Vocational High School of Hotel Administration.
-  I’m interested in korean language,food, culture , architecture. Also some of history of South Korea, Japan and China.
-  I've currently started to learn HTML,CSS,JS as of 02.02.2024... I started learning the basics while starting a project (website) at the same time. Today I spent around 16hours learning and coding, not by force. Because I found programming chilly and interesting also a worthy experience. Coding and programming caught my interest in times of games
  and then in times of AI. I am looking forward to share with you some of my newbie beginner littlesteps and as the time flows and projects growth I hope for honest opinions and advices :)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on simple new projects that could help me get the usefull knowledge.
